# Rubix-Cubes
Progress with cubing 

### Day 1 
#### Cube Type | A012s  
Pyraminx Duo: 14:21 <br>
Pyraminx: 2:41:59 <br>
Skewb 3:23:57 :


### Day 2 
#### Cube Type | A012s  
Pyraminx Duo: 13:98 <br>
Pyraminx: 2:51:05 <br>
Skewb: 3:10:52

### Day 3 
#### Cube Type | A012s 
Pyraminx Duo: 10:52 <br>
Pyraminx: 2:10:42 <br> 
Skewb: 2:57:12

### Day 4 
#### Cube Type | A012s 
Pyraminx Duo: 8:22 <br>
Pyraminx: 2:05:42  <br>
Skewb: 2:51:95

### Day 5

Pyraminx: 1:53:95 <br>
Skewb: 2:42:12 

### Timed Solves for the Pyraminx 
1 - 1:24:897 <br>
2 - 3:12.882 <br>
3 - 2:11.752 <br>
4 - DNF <br>
5 - DNF <br> 
I have the DNFs because I ran out of class time, not because I could not solve it. 

### What I Learned 
I started off this course not knowing how to solve any kind of rubix cube, so I feel that I have progressed a lot. I learned how to use algorithms, but more importantly, I learned how to be flexible with them. I tried to avoid being a robot executing lines of code; rather, I tried to understand how the algorithm worked. Ultimatley, this helped me be more confident, helped me get quicker solves, and I feel that it has provided me a good foundation for when I move on to the 3X3 cube.
